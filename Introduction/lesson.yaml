- Class: script
  Output: "I just opened an R script for you that contains some commented code (# in front of each line) as well as a spot for you to create a new vector called 'characters' \n\n Follow the instructions to complete the script. When you think you have it, save the script and type submit(). \n\nIf you mess up, type reset() to start from scratch."
  AnswerTests: script_results_identical('characters'); multi_expr_creates_var('characters')
  Hint: Follow the directions in the script comments very carefully. If R gave you an error above, try to understand what it is telling you. If you get stuck, type reset() to start with a fresh script, then save the script and type submit() when you are ready.
