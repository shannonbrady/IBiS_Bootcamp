# Introduction to R template!

#### INTRODUCTION ####
# make a character vector of disney characters


# check the class of 'characters'


# make a numeric vector of dates


# check the class of 'dates'


# make a logical vector of princess


# check the class of 'princess'


# combine 'characters', 'dates', and 'princess' to make a new dataframe


# view your new dataframe


# look at the structure of the dataframe


# change the characters column to be a character not factor


# how many rows does the dataframe have?


# how many columns does the dataframe have?


# looking at your dataframe by row


# looking at your dataframe by column


# looking at one 'cell' of your dataframe


#### LOGIC ####

# which elements of characters (if any) are equal to "Cinderella"?


# what elements of characters are not equal to "Cinderella"?


# is "Cinderella" in the characters vector?


# Are there movies older than 1995?


# IF/ELSE statements - print "Hello, Cinderella" if character is Cinderella, otherwise print "You're not Cinderella"


# ON YOUR OWN (OYO) - use if/else to print "Before me!" or "After me!" for each movie based on if it came out before or after you were born


# For loops - introduction


# For loops - print each character


# For loops - more advanced
# print each character IF they are a princess ELSE print "Not a princess."
