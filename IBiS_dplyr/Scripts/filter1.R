# Filter out only certain rows in the dataset.

# dplyr::filter() tells R that we want to look into the dplyr package for the function filter()
# The filter function takes two arguments: dataframe, logic
#
# Use dplyr::filter() to filter through the starwars data frame and keep all the humans.
# We will save this subset of the data as a new dataframe called humans.
#
# Note: in the data frame, "Human" is spelled with a capital H!
humans <- dplyr::filter()
